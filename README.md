In this project I successfully web-scraped published articles and weather data to analyze patterns on planet Mars. I identified HTML elements needed to extract web-based information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. From the data collected, I created visuals to illustrate when the warm and cold months on Mars occur. I was able to determine Mars approximate 'annual' cycle times based on it's recurring weather patterns.
